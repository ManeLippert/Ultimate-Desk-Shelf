![desk-shelf](/images/desk-shelf/Desk_Shelf_V3.png)

I build as a summer project an desk shelf for my desk. It is inspirated by the [**Balolo Setup Cockpit**](https://www.balolo.de/products/setup-cockpit-large) and the desk shelf build in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od2um2CjXf8&pp=ygUOZGVzayBzaGVsZiBkaXk%3D).

### Simularities

- Fully compatible with Balolo desk shelf [accessories](https://www.balolo.de/collections/setup-cockpit-accessories) 
- Placement if the speakers unter the desk shelf
- Middle section for more storage space

### Differences
- Mounting Grid under the middle section
- Longer shelf plate to place monitor (up to 34") in the middle of the shelf with the use of the [laptop stand from Balolo](https://www.balolo.de/collections/setup-cockpit-accessories/products/laptop-riser)
- Use of dowels to mount feet to the plate

## Materials
- 50 x M5 threaded inserts for wood with 10mm (0.39in) depth
- 2 x wood plates with at least
    - Length: 125cm (49,21in)
    - Width: 21cm (8,27in)
    - Thickness: 1.8cm (7.09in)
